# Diffusion AI

## Overview

Welcome to `diffusion_ai`! This small library is the result of my learning journey from the "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" course. This course, created by Jeremy Howard, Jonathan Whitaker, and Tanishq Abraham, PhD, covers the Stable Diffusion algorithm and its variants from scratch. It has over 30 hours of video content and provides rigorous coverage of the latest techniques in deep learning.

### Course Highlights

In the course, you will:
- Implement Stable Diffusion and other diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM.
- Explore deep learning topics such as neural network architectures, data augmentation, and various loss functions.
- Build models from scratch including MLPs, ResNets, Unets, autoencoders, and transformers.
- Use PyTorch to implement models and create a deep learning framework called miniai.
- Master Python concepts to keep your code clean and efficient.
- Apply fundamental concepts like tensors, calculus, and pseudo-random number generation to machine learning techniques.
